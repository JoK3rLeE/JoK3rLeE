# A Short Story about myself this year 
### I've continue working with dotOS for Xiaomi Mi 9 (cepheus)  

Yes it's true, But this year isn't good for me I guess. 
1. During chinese new year, I lost my Mi 9 during vacation.. So I spend my allowance on Used Mi 9 ( luckily not that expensive, Just around 200USD), I 
   guess it's worth it as the person reduce the price after hearing me lost my phone and I'm just A student.. 
   
2. When dotOS is on Alpha stage, I've started to build for Mi 9, while it's on Alpha stage I working on device trees as most of the function isn't support yet.
   And I got Covid-19. Since then I suspended the work and fully focus on recovering from the sickness. 

3. Yesterday.. I accidentally drop my phone from 3rd storey while taking photos. Now I can't test my own build anymore.. So, Whoever Love's my work, Please 
   give me some times to purchase motherboard from china. Hopefully by next month I can use my allowance to buy cheap board (Around $60 USD only). I've spend a 
   lot on education Loans, Medical fees for covid and dentist. 

I hope everyone will stay safe and stay healthy.
